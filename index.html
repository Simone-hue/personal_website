            Hello everyone, my name is Simone. You all are probably wondering why I wanted to create this site. Well, one of my passions is coding and programming, that's why I decided to attend USI, Universti√† dell Svizzera Italiana and one of my assignment was to create this site. So... what do you think is here? Fortunately, I've already thought about this little problem and that's why I decided to create a mini overview for you, so that you can choose what you want to read, if you want to read something about me and if you have nothing more interesting than known my business.
            <br>
            Welcome to my personal website.
            <br>
            Ps: You can choose whether to follow the order of the topics &#40;in this case you will always have to return to the homepage&#41;, or jump from one to another using the links on the navbar

                First of all I would like to introduced myself. In the page you can find some of mine personal information, what I like to do, what are some of my dreams &#40;but remember there are two pages dedicated to the second and third topics&#41;. I think if I started writing everything here it would lose interest in go deaply into the site, so come on and click below to find out where I come from, how many brothers or sisters I have, and whether I have any pets or nothing at all... come on man, I'm waiting you in the other page ;&#41; .

                Well, you've reached my second topic, which is my favorite one because I like to do everything. Bad news for you, I'm not a good writer, so I decided to tell you about only three of my best hobbies. Which ones are they? hey... do you think I'm foolish enough to spoil them for you? Of course I don't write here what they are, so you can go to the page and discorver. Yeah... I know... you can see one of them thanks to the photo, but you can't understand if it's just an hobby or much more. So, if you're curious, click below and start reading about my hobbies.

                Cool, you are at the end of my site. I am very excited because if you there most probably you have already read all the other pages and for me it is a fantastic achievement. But now it is not the time to be a sentimental because you are probably here to know the third and last, but not least, topic about me. Well, after saying who I am, what I like to do, I think the best is to talk about my dreams. Some of them are unachievable, others are somewhere in between and then there are some that I could reach if and only if I will work harder and harder until I reach them... am I ready? Well, if you want to know the answer, please click below and discover my latest secrets.
