                    One of my dreams that no one knows about is to become a professional car or motorcycle driver. Even my parents didn't know about this dream, it's the first time I've talked about it. Since I was a child I have always had a great passion for driving and beautiful cars/motorcycles, a passion that has grown with me. When I got older and could start taking my first lessons, I realized that it would not be possible to realize this secret dream because my parents would never have allowed me to do it and also many people know that it is too dangerous with high risck; furthermore only a few people manage to reach professional levels and, above all, the overall cost for this career is very high, it is estimated that you will have to spent around 2 million euros and it is impossible to start competing as payers without any help from the sponsors. For these and other reasons I have never dedicated myself to this world but this small but big dream will always remain in my heart... who knows one day I will be able to race with my friends on one of those tracks with our motorbikes/cars sports

                    One of my dreams that could still come true is to become a professional footballer. Since I was a child I have had this dream which, in these 15 years, I have always tried to realize. In these years I had the opportunity to express my skills in a few teams, but I also had the opportunity to play against very important Italian and foreign teams such as Sevilia. At the moment I have not yet signed any professional contract, but I have had the opportunity to do some trainigs for some teams such as Inter, Novara, Milan. As already mentioned in my hobbies, I also had the opportunity to play with the Renate first team and be called up to some matches. Unfortunately I didn't have the chance to make my debut in the Serie C or in the Italian Cup, but I was able to play in some friendly matches against some Serie C and Seria A teams such as Monza. In those moments I felt many emotions but I will never forget the satisfaction of being there and the possibility of showing my skills. Ahimè, I haven't reached this goal yet but it's still possible because I'm still young and maybe in the next few years I'll play very well enough to intrigue some important teams and be bought. My dream is to become a Juventus' footballer because it is my favourite team

                    My passion for coding and programming was born on its own but it's a positive thing because I know that no one forces me to do something that I don't want to do or I do something just to do it without having an interest. Fortunally, I have transformed this innate passion into a dream, a dream that is more achievable than many others; what should I do to achieve it? Simple, I have to study a lot, a lot and a lot more, I must never stop working. Why is this dream achievable? Because I plan a trip that started this year &#40;2023&#41; attending the university studies at USI, <i>Universtià Svizzera Italiana</i>, attending the bachelor of informatics. The question that is usually difficult to answer is: "What do you want to become?". Well, to this question I know what to answer <i>"I want to become someone who does something important and can be remembered".</i> My greatest desire is to create something that will last, something that everyone uses and that makes other people's lives more beautiful/simple/fun/peaceful. What will I want to create? Ah well, there is no answer to this question yet because at the moment I don't have much ideas, is wonderful if this whole site turns out well. Do you want to know the meaning? Well, actually I consider myself quite good at programming but my biggest problem is that I can never have ideas on what to do, I always know or discover the "how" but the "what" is my Achilles heel. In recent years I have improved my desing skills but my gap is still a lot, it almost seems to use the logic of Moore's law, my skills increase faster than my creativity as a new cpu with number of transistors per chips increased by a constant amount would be released while RAM has a much slower evolution. Yeah, this is a skill about an other subject, Computer Architecture which is more complicated. So my question for you is... What is your possible dream?
